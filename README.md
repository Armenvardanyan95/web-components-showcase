# WebComponents

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.2.2, but has been upgraded to use Angular 10 RC.

## How to run

This project uses @angular/elements to bootstrap a minimal button web component.
To make it work install the dependencies using 

`$ npm install`

And then run 

`$ ng build FirstWebComponent`

This will generate the Web Component js files. Then simply open the "`web-component.showcase.html`"
file to see the button. You can make changes to the web component and re0run the build process to see the changes. Or you can run

`$ ng build FirstWebComponent --watch`

to get hot rebuilding (note that you will still have to reload the browser tab  manually).
